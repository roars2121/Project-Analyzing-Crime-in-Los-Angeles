## Project Overview

Los Angeles is known for its sunshine and silver screens, but high population density brings challenges in public safety. This project supports the LAPD by:

- Profiling crime trends by geography, time, and victim demographics  
- Identifying hotspots and high‚Äêrisk windows  
- Equipping decision‚Äêmakers with actionable insights  

Our single data source is a modified snapshot from Los Angeles Open Data, containing every reported crime with location, type, victim details, and status.
